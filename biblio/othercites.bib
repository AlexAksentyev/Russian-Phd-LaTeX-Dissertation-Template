	The total spin precession frequency in the vertical plane due to

	The position of the ring elements is unchanged from clockwise to counter-clockwise operation.
	The calibration of the effective Lorentz factor using the polarization precession frequency measurement
	in the horizontal plane is carried out alternately in each CW and CCW operation.
	And the approximate relationship between the frequencies of the polarization precession
	in different planes is set to exclude them from mixing to the vertical frequency of
	the expected EDM signal at a sensitivity level approaching $10{-29}~e\cdot cm$.},

	abstract = {Precision experiments, such as the search for electric dipole moments
	of charged particles using storage rings, demand for an understanding of the spin dynamics
	with unprecedented accuracy. The ultimate aim is to measure the electric dipole moments
	with a sensitivity up to 15 orders in magnitude better than the magnetic dipole moment
	of the stored particles. This formidable task requires an understanding of the background
	to the signal of the electric dipole from rotations of the spins in the spurious magnetic fields
	of a storage ring. One of the observables, especially sensitive to the imperfection magnetic fields
	in the ring is the angular orientation of stable spin axis. Up to now, the stable spin axis has never
	been determined experimentally, and in addition, the JEDI collaboration for the first time succeeded
	to quantify the background signals that stem from false rotations of the magnetic dipole moments
	in the horizontal and longitudinal imperfection magnetic fields of the storage ring. To this end,
	we developed a new method based on the spin tune response of a machine to artificially applied
	longitudinal magnetic fields. This novel technique, called \emph{spin tune mapping}, emerges as
	a very powerful tool to probe the spin dynamics in storage rings. The technique was experimentally
	tested in 2014 at the cooler synchrotron COSY, and for the first time, the angular orientation of
	the stable spin axis at two different locations in the ring has been determined to an unprecedented
	accuracy of better than $2.8\mu$rad.},

	doi = {10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2015-MOPWA044},
	abstract = {To search for EDM using proton storage ring with purely electrostatic elements
	the concept of frozen spin method has been proposed by BNL. This method is based on two facts:
	in the equation of the spin precession the magnetic field dependence is entirely eliminated and
	at ``magic'' energy the spin precession frequency coincides with the precession frequency of
	the momentum. In case of deuteron the anomalous magnetic moment is negative (G=-0.142),
	therefore we have to use the electrical and magnetic field simultaneously keeping the
	frozen spin direction along the momentum as in the pure electrostatic ring. In this article
	we suggest the concept of the quasi-frozen spin when the spin oscillates around the momentum direction
	within the half value of the advanced spin phase each time returning back by special optics.
	Due to the low value of the anomalous magnetic moment of deuteron an effective contribution to
	the expected EDM effect is reduced only by a few percent.},

	different  from  the first one the Lorentz factor and charge to mass ratio will  be  used
