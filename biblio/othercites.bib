	abstract = {To search for EDM using proton storage ring with purely electrostatic elements
	the concept of frozen spin method has been proposed by BNL. This method is based on two facts:
	in the equation of the spin precession the magnetic field dependence is entirely eliminated and
	at ``magic'' energy the spin precession frequency coincides with the precession frequency of
	the momentum. In case of deuteron the anomalous magnetic moment is negative (G=-0.142),
	therefore we have to use the electrical and magnetic field simultaneously keeping the
	frozen spin direction along the momentum as in the pure electrostatic ring. In this article
	we suggest the concept of the quasi-frozen spin when the spin oscillates around the momentum direction
	within the half value of the advanced spin phase each time returning back by special optics.
	Due to the low value of the anomalous magnetic moment of deuteron an effective contribution to
	the expected EDM effect is reduced only by a few percent.},

As a proof-of-concept, the {COoler} {SYnchrotron} ({COSY}) was equipped with a waveguide {RF} Wien filter designed to operate at some harmonics of the spin precession frequency ranging from 0.1 to 2 {MHz}. This device maintains the corresponding ratio between the {RF} electric and magnetic fields necessary not to induce any beam excitation and most importantly acts as a spin flipper. In the course of 2017, the waveguide {RF} Wien has been successfully commissioned and tested. The ability of the device to produce a Lorentz Force compensation and to rotate the particles' polarization vector has been verified. Driven vertical spin oscillations and vertical polarization build-up has been observed. This short article briefly discusses the results of the Lorentz force measurements at 871 {kHz}.},

	journal = {Physica Scripta},
	abstract = {The measurement of a non-zero electric dipole moment (EDM) aligned along the spin of sub-atomic particles would probe new physics beyond the standard model. It has been proposed to search for the EDM of charged particles using a storage ring and a longitudinally polarized beam. The EDM signal would be a rotation of the polarization from the horizontal plane toward the vertical direction as a consequence of the radial electric field always present in the particle frame. This experiment requires ring conditions that can ensure a lifetime of the in-plane polarization (spin coherence time, SCT) up to 1000 s. A study has begun at the COoler SYnchrotron (COSY) located at the Forschungszentrum JÃŒlich to examine the effects of emittance and momentum spread on the SCT of a polarized deuteron beam at 0.97 GeV/c. A special Data AcQuisition has been developed in order to provide a direct measurement of a rapidly rotating horizontal polarization as a function of time. The set of data presented here shows how second-order effects from emittance and momentum spread of the beam affect the lifetime of the horizontal polarization of a bunched beam. It has been demonstrated that sextupole fields can be used to correct for these depolarizing sources and increase the SCT up to hundreds of seconds.}
