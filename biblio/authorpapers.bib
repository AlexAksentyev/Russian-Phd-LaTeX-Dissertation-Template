	abstract = {Currently, the ``J\"ulich Electric Dipole moment Investigations'' (JEDI) collaboration, together with present EDM experiments at the COSY ring, is developing the conceptual design of a ring specifically for the search for the deuteron electric dipole moment (dEDM). One of the main problems in the EDM study is the spin precession in the vertical plane caused by the non-ideal positioning of accelerator elements through the magnetic dipole moment (MDM). The idea of how to separate the EDM from MDM is based on measuring the spin tune in different processes and comparing the results. The high precision of the spin tune measurement is achieved by collecting huge amounts of data. The JEDI collaboration aims at detecting the EDM at a level better than 10$^{-29}~e\cdot$cm, for which one requires a precision in the frequency estimate 10$^{-9}$ rad/sec. An estimateâ€™s statistical precision is conditional on the following factors: the total measurement time, determining the independent variable spread; measurement error; temporal modulation and spacing of sample points. In this paper we analyze the interplay between these factors, and estimate the best achievable precision under given conditions.}
