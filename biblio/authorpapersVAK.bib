	abstract = {The method is based on four fundamental features. The total spin precession frequency in the vertical plane due to the electric and magnetic dipole moments in an imperfect ring in a vertical plane is measured. The position of the ring elements is unchanged from clockwise to counter-clockwise operation. The calibration of the effective Lorentz factor using the polarization precession frequency measurement in the horizontal plane is carried out alternately in each {CW} and {CCW} operation. And the approximate relationship between the frequencies of the polarization precession in different planes is set to exclude them from mixing to the vertical frequency of the expected {EDM} signal at a sensitivity level approaching $10^{-29}~e\cdot$cm.}
